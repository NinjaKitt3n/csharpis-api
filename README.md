## Prerequisities

You will need either the ASP.NET Core Runtimes or SDK in order to run this API. Both can be [downloaded here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).

> NOTE: In order to develop this code you'll need the SDK and an IDE (VS, VSCode, Rider, etc)

## Useful Commands

- `dotnet build` to restore dependencies and build the project.
- `dotnet run` to run the application in development mode.
- `dotnet CSharpIs.Api.dll` to run the output (ensure terminal pointed to correct output directory)
